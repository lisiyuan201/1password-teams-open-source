Recommend access to WeChat payment

Hello: I am a customer from mainland China. I have been using 1Password for three years. I have bought permanent copyright software on the computer, and I also use it on the mobile phone app, but there is only a short free trial period on the phone app. After that, the account is frozen. In this process, I can't synchronize the electricity. A new account password on the brain, very annoying, many times want to pay, but due to the lack of sufficient means of payment in app support, only on the web, and the web site does not support the localization of WeChat, Alipay, so many times are in the process of payment;
This is also the reason why I give you advice. More and more customers in China are willing to pay to use reassuring products / services in mainland China, while 1Password is blind to the local payment methods in mainland China and misses a large number of paid customer opportunities.
Right, I am engaged in third party payment practitioners, if 1Password needs, with very simple procedures, I can provide you with a very low rate of payment channel, hope 1Password related leaders, colleagues can adopt;
